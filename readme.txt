Plot
====

You're an ensign and you have to calibrate the shields.

Voices
======

Level 1 - Weapons officer

* The blarg are attacking, captain!

* Shields at 80% captain!

* Captain, shields are down to 20%!

* Shields failing! We can't take another hit!

* It is a good day to die!!!

* We can now damage their systems, captain!


Level 2 - Engineering

* We need to calibrate our shield frequency to match their energy signature, so we can send a feedback loop through our sensor array!

* They blarg are changing their sequencing. We need to compensate!

* I have damage reports coming in from all decks, sir!

* Sir, the reactor core integrity is faiding!

* Sir, one more hit and she's gonna blow!

* The reactor is imploding!

* The alignment is set, sir!

Level 3 - Captain

* Get these frequencies to match their weapon pattern!

* They are adapting. Recalibrate the shields, ensign!

* Sickbay, prepare for wounded!

* Send rescue teams to deck 7, 8, 12 and 14!

* We need those calibrations now or never, ensign!

* All hands abandon ship! I repeat, all hands, abandon ship!

* Good work!

* Fire!

* Fire at will!
